       <H1> The Camino Francés</H1>
    <body>
        <p>The Camino Francés, the most popular route of the Camino de Santiago, traces its origins to the early Middle Ages, when Santiago de Compostela became one of the three great Christian pilgrimage centers alongside Rome and Jerusalem. After the discovery of the relics of Saint James in the 9th century, pilgrims began to travel from across Europe to Galicia. By the 11th and 12th centuries, the Camino Francés—crossing the Pyrenees at Roncesvalles or Somport and stretching through northern Spain—was established as the principal route. Monarchs, monasteries, and towns supported the pilgrimage by building roads, bridges, churches, and hospitals, ensuring safety and hospitality for travelers. The Codex Calixtinus, a 12th-century guidebook, further codified the path, cementing its role as a spiritual and cultural artery of medieval Europe.
Over time, pilgrimage numbers waxed and waned. The Camino declined in the later Middle Ages due to war, plague, and changing religious practices, but never disappeared entirely. In the 20th century, the route experienced a dramatic revival, spurred by renewed interest in cultural heritage, spiritual tourism, and the recognition of the Camino as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. Modern infrastructure—such as marked trails, hostels (albergues), and pilgrim services—has grown around the route, while regional governments and local communities promote it as both a religious journey and a cultural experience. Today, the Camino Francés attracts hundreds of thousands annually, a blend of faithful pilgrims, secular walkers, and international travelers, making it not just a medieval path of devotion but a modern global phenomenon.</p>
