        <h1>Alta Via 1</h1>

        <p>
           Alta Via 1 is one of the first serious trails I did with my mom and dad, when I was about 11 and my brother was 9. It's one of the trails that seriously made me fall in love with hiking, and in particular, backpacking — only by long overnight trails and true endurance can you begin to reach these incredible places, and the tilted cliffs and impossibly jagged combs and tooths of the Italian Alps shocked me to my core in the best way possible. 
        </p>

        <p>
           The Alta Via 1 is a classic long-distance route running through the Dolomites in northern Italy, known for its dramatic limestone peaks, glacial valleys, and rifugi that offer warm meals and bunk-style lodging. It is surprisingly varied — moving from sharp, exposed passes to quiet meadows within the same day. Despite being world-famous, the Alta Via 1 still feels wild in stretches, partly because its pathways follow old trade and military routes dating back to World War I. Many sections wind through former front lines and supply corridors, embedding the landscape with a sense of living history. Today, the trail is maintained for sustainable alpine tourism, blending Italy’s tradition of mountain hospitality with the preservation of its high-altitude cultural and geological heritage.
