        <h1>Corfu Trail</h1>

        <p>
           The sun is rising above a smooth island in the distance and a shimmery, rubbed-out horizon that is the sea. Crickets are vibrantly filling the air and a gentle wind runs across your skin as you move across the dry dirt. This is the Corfu Trail, one that you absolutely must see, and of course, walk. The Corfu Trail is a long-distance footpath that runs the length of the Greek island of Corfu, weaving through olive groves, limestone hills, quiet villages, and protected coastal landscapes. Known for its gentle but steady challenges, the trail offers a surprisingly diverse mix of terrain—from golden beaches and cliffside paths to lush mountain passes near the island’s spine. Despite Corfu’s popularity as a tourist destination, the Corfu Trail remains relatively peaceful, especially on inland segments where time feels slower and the landscape more traditional. Much of the route follows old mule tracks and agricultural paths once used by villagers traveling between settlements or tending to terraced fields. Today, the trail continues that legacy, offering a slow, human-scale way to experience Corfu’s cultural and ecological heritage while supporting local, low-impact tourism.
